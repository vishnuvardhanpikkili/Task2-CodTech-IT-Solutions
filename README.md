## Overview of the Project

**Project Name: Finite State Machine Design**

## Objectives
- Design and implement a finite state machine using Verilog HDL.
- Simulate and verify the FSM using Xilinx 14.7.
- Understand the basic concepts of FSM design and implementation.

## Key Activities

- Created testbenches for simulation and verification.
- Simulated the FSM using Xilinx 14.7.
- Analyzed and debugged the simulation results.

## Tools Used
- Xilinx 14.7 (ISE Design Suite)
- Verilog HDL
